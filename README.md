# map-project

This is a school project for a JavaScript course. Its purpose is to mainly practice using APIs. We chose to use the Leaflet library along with the open JSON API by Digitraffic to show data of ships currently on the move on the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland.

Later we also added the use of OpenWeatherMap to show basic weather information of the selected ship's area.

Other features include being able to search for the ships by their name or their MMSI, as well as being able to filter ships by their types.
